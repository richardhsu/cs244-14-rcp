# Custom Processor Sharing

This part of the simulation requires the RCP simulations to have executed
first. This simulation utilizes RCP's output data to calculate flow
completion times on the same data.

Given the data, this custom processor sharing simulation will give equal
bandwidth to all active flows in each interval. Then output flow
completion times to be used later for analysis.
